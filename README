Our experiences with HipProofAnalysis and PROOF for CHEP'09 proceedings.

Figures:

- Place figures under fig/ subdirectory (doesn't exist yet)
- Currently using latex -> dvips -> ps2pdf chain (this may change to
  pdflatex in the future)
- Figures should be stored in EPS format
- If the figure is generated from some other format (which is easier
  to edit), the original figure should be stored too
  * If some modifications are needed, it's easier to do them in the
    original
- Examples:
  * For ROOT, store figure.C and figure.eps
  * for Inkscape, store figure.svg and figure.eps
